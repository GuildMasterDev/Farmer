# macOS Installation Instructions

## Important: Security Warning

Since Artist is not yet notarized by Apple, macOS will show a warning that the app is "damaged" or "can't be opened" when you first try to run it. This is a security feature, not an actual problem with the app.

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Remove Quarantine (Recommended)

After downloading and extracting Artist.app:

1. Open Terminal
2. Run this command:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /path/to/Artist.app
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/` with the actual path where you extracted the app (e.g., `~/Downloads/Artist.app`)

3. Double-click Artist.app to run

### Method 2: Right-Click to Open

1. Download and extract Artist.app
2. Right-click (or Control-click) on Artist.app
3. Select "Open" from the context menu
4. Click "Open" in the security dialog

### Method 3: System Preferences

1. Try to open Artist.app normally (it will be blocked)
2. Open System Preferences â†’ Security & Privacy
3. In the General tab, you'll see a message about Artist being blocked
4. Click "Open Anyway"

## Why Does This Happen?

macOS uses Gatekeeper to protect users from potentially harmful software. Apps distributed outside the Mac App Store need to be:
- Code signed with a valid Apple Developer certificate
- Notarized by Apple

Artist is currently using ad-hoc signing for development. In future releases, we plan to implement proper code signing and notarization.

## Is It Safe?

Yes! Artist is open source and you can review all the code at:
https://github.com/GuildMasterDev/Artist

The app only:
- Displays a collection of curated resource links
- Opens links in your default browser
- Does not collect any personal data
- Does not require special permissions

## Still Having Issues?

If you continue to have problems:
1. Make sure you've fully extracted the .zip file before running
2. Try moving Artist.app to your Applications folder first
3. Check that your macOS version is compatible (10.12 or later)
